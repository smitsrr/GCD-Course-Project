Downloaded raw data from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

Save the following files into your working directory:
  features.txt
  subject_test.txt
  subject_train.txt
  X_test.txt
  X_train.txt
  y_test.txt
  y_train.txt
  
When the code is run it will merge the Test and Train datasets for each pariticipant (1-30). 
  -It then adds the column names using features.txt.  We are only interested in mean and standard deviation
  variables so we only keep variables that contain "ean" or "std". 
  -Next, we add the activity names that each participant performed (either walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, 
  sitting, standing, or lying). 
  -To make the variable names more readable we eliminate all of the characters that are in the variable names (i.e., "(", ")")
  -The last step is that we calculate the mean of each variable for each participant for each activity. 
  
The output of running the code will be a data file saved to your working directory with the resultint tidy dataset: "courseProject.txt"
